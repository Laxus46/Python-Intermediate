# Module 13

- **First class function**
    
    In Python, a first-class function is a function that can be assigned to a variable, passed as an argument to another function, or returned as a value from a function. This means that functions in Python are treated as first-class citizens, just like any other data type (such as integers, strings, and lists).
    
- **Closures**
    
    Closure is a nested function that helps us access the outer function's variables even after the outer function is closed.
    
- `__call__`
    
    Python has a set of built-in methods and `__call__` is one of them. The `__call__` method enables Python programmers to write classes where the instances behave like functions and can be called like a function.
    
- **Decorator**
    
    A decorator is a function that takes another function and extends the behavior of the latter function without explicitly modifying it.
